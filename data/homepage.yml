  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am back, after a few days of vacationing! Weather was decent, the layers were plenty,
    and I managed to not slip on any ice, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
    good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in product engineering, project planning / organization, requirement analysis as well as
    leading full-stack engineering teams. I enjoy designing and coding quality applications as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.

      content: "Quintessa is one of the most persistent and determined students I've had the pleasure to assist in learning to code. She put in an unmatched effort during her time in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp: attending office hours at least twice a week, reviewing past assignments in detail with instructors and teaching assistants, and contributing to class message channels frequently to discuss code topics. As a result, she had the largest arc of improvement in the course. Quintessa came into the program with very little previous experience and left with front end and back end skills. She has the determination to succeed in whichever avenue she chooses."
